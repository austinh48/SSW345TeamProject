1.) We want to create a focusbot style of bot for this project
2.) a. Our bot would help students stay productive and be aware of upcoming deadlines that they have for assignments.
    b. This is worth solving beacause a lot of students struggle to work ahead on projects and end up trying to do everything last minute
3.) a. We want a bot that works as a calender in a way and will send you notifications reminding you about asignments that get more frequenct the closer you get to the deadline
    b. As of now, our basic ideas that we have generated are as follows:
    
  Functionality: 

	Friendly vs. Streamlined 

	Monitor screentime? 

	Give daily reminders 

	Take a todo list - maybe they could be scheduled with due dates 

	Could take daily/reoccurring reminders (ie medication reminders) 

	Give praise for crossing something off todo list 

	Maybe play lofi beats for focusing? 

	Remind specific tasks that have stayed in todo list 

	Remind about close due dates
