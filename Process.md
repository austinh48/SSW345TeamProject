We followed our process by getting all of the inital base code done, with the exception of the sign in feature because that will require the most amount of time/detail and is not a neccessary detail, but is one that would be nice to have. All of the other base components are working, the only other thing to add besides the sign in feature is customization for the users, if we have time.
