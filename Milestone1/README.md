Problem Statement:
The problem that our group wishes to address is procrastination/poor organization. A lot of students struggle with keeping on top of their homework/assignments and we want to create a bot that helps solve this issue. The reason that procrastination is such a big problem is because it is so easy to push a homework assignment to the next day or forget about a long term project. With our bot the goal is to have the bot send automatic reminders for assignments that you have, with the reminders being more/less frequent depending on how close the assignment is. With "frequent" reminders about your future assigments it will be much harder to procrastinate/forget about assignments.
