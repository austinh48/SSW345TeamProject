Project Management:

We followed our process by getting all of the inital base code done, with the exception of the sign in feature because that will require the most amount of time/detail and is not a neccessary detail, but is one that would be nice to have. All of the other base components are working, the only other thing to add besides the sign in feature is customization for the users, if we have time. With each iteration, we would read over the code and check to see what was needed and what wasn't. We would constantly push to the repo once we made sure the code worked so we would always have working code. The reason that we don't have written down planing details is because we would meet in person to code and just talk over what our plan was while we were there. Also, due to the api key changing everytime when being pushed into github, we found it more viable to work in person to avoid the hindrance of it. We used our use case file and architecture plan to decide what we wanted to code and the order we coded each function in. Lastly, since we were in person (we would meet once a week), it looks like there was an uneven contribution from the team since we wrote the code on Sean's computer and would push from there, github makes it seem like he was the only one that contributed.
