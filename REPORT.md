This bot is designed to solve the problem of procrastination/forgetting that you have assignments due. The bot takes user input with certain specs, such as assignment name, due date, and assignment priority. The bot sends daily notications about the assignment. The user can also list the assignments that are currently in the database and delete them or mark them as complete.

Looking back on this process I feel like we could've done a little better with our development process since we didn't really upload to github until we got closer to the end of the project, but other than that I think the process and project went pretty smoothly. If we were going to continue this project and further develop it, I think we would add the option to sign into canvas and pull assignments from there that way you wouldn't have to manually add everything. Also, adding user input to specify the time that assignments were sent would be added too. Lastly, cleaning up the formatting of the list of assignments when the !list command is ran would be something we could do as well. All in all, this was a fun project and a great way to get experience working with discord and firebase.
